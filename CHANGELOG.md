# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Parallax never worked after the entrance animation**: the `fill: 'both'` animation kept overriding the inline `transform`, and with the default `once: true` the progress observer was disconnected on first entry. Finished animations now commit their end state and are cancelled; the progress observer stays active.
- **`repeat` did not re-hide elements** (the old filling animation kept them visible) and stacked a new `Animation` on every entry. Running animations are now tracked, cancelled and replaced.
- **SSR**: `init()` / `observe()` threw `ReferenceError: document is not defined` on the server. All entry points are now no-ops without a DOM.
- **No IntersectionObserver**: elements were hidden and then `observe()` threw, leaving content invisible. Content is now shown immediately.
- **Reduced motion** was ignored by the React/Vue integrations and by parallax. Elements are no longer hidden and no motion is applied when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set (callbacks still fire).
- **`offset`** discarded the right/left sides of `rootMargin` and produced an invalid margin (`--20px`, which throws) for negative offsets.
- **`threshold` arrays** (including `data-sa-threshold="0,0.5"`) were truncated to the first value.
- **Custom easing functions** only interpolated `translateY`; every other transform (scale, rotate, translateX, combined presets) jumped at 50%. Uses CSS `linear()` where supported, and generic value interpolation otherwise.
- **`stagger`** delays grew with every registered sibling, so items scrolled into view later waited seconds. Stagger is now relative to the batch of siblings revealed together.
- **`refresh()`** re-hid and replayed elements that had already animated.
- **`unobserve()` / `destroy()`** left never-animated elements permanently invisible.
- **Detached elements** were kept in the registry forever (memory leak in SPAs); they are now pruned.
- **`useClassNames`** never applied `hiddenClass` on observe (only after a `repeat` leave).
- **React hooks** used stale callbacks from the first render and ignored `once`, `offset` and easing functions; Vue composable likewise. Both now delegate to the core engine.
- Malformed `data-sa-easing` JSON or invalid easing strings no longer throw; numeric `data-sa-parallax-x/y` values are treated as px; NaN numeric attributes are ignored.
- Vanilla example used TypeScript syntax and a non-existent `ScrollAnimate.createScrollAnimate`.

### Changed

- **Performance**: IntersectionObservers are shared between elements with the same root/threshold/rootMargin instead of one (or two, with a 101-step threshold list) per element.
- Removed the `browser` field from `package.json` (it made webpack resolve the minified UMD build instead of the ESM build); added `unpkg`, `jsdelivr`, `files`, `sideEffects`, repository metadata, and real `test`/`typecheck` scripts.
- `ParallaxOptions` is now exported from the package entry.
- Preset end keyframes use explicit units (`translateY(0px)`, `rotateX(0deg)`); visually identical.
- `tsconfig` uses `moduleResolution: "bundler"` (TypeScript 6 rejects `node`/`node10`).
- Added a Vitest + jsdom test suite (25 tests).
- README: accurate size, full option/attribute table, instance API, UMD, React & Vue usage.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- **Custom Easing Curves**: Support for passing a `cubic-bezier` array (e.g., `[0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1]`) to the `easing` option.
- **Easing Functions**: Support for passing a custom JavaScript function `(t: number) => number` to the `easing` option for complete control over animation timing.
- **New Physics Presets**: Added `soft-spring` and `heavy-bounce` easing presets.
- **HTML Data Attribute Support**: Added support for parsing JSON-style arrays in `data-sa-easing` (e.g., `data-sa-easing="[0.1, 0.7, 1.0, 0.1]"`).

### Changed

- Updated `EasingType` to include `number[]` and `(t: number) => number`.
- Refactored `runAnimation` to handle custom easing functions by generating intermediate keyframes.
- Enhanced `resolveEasing` to handle array-based cubic-bezier definitions.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- **Once Control**: New `once` option to automatically stop observing an element after its animation has triggered, saving system resources.
- **Viewport Offset**: New `offset` option to specify how many pixels an element must enter the viewport before the animation starts.
- **New Animation Presets**: Added `shimmer`, `pulse`, and `swing`.
- **Multi-language Documentation**: Added Chinese (`README_zh.md`) and Japanese (`README_ja.md`) documentation.
- **Fallback Support**: Added a fallback mechanism for browsers that do not support the Web Animations API.

### Fixed

- **Memory Leak**: Improved `IntersectionObserver` cleanup by using `disconnect()` instead of `unobserve()` in key areas.
- **Stagger Bug**: Fixed an issue where `stagger` animation indices were incorrectly calculated when DOM elements were added dynamically.
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript definitions for better developer experience.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- **Multiple Animations**: Support for applying multiple animation presets simultaneously (e.g., `["fade-in-up", "zoom-in"]`).
- **Parallax Effect**: New `parallax` option for creating scroll-driven parallax effects (`x`, `y`, `rotate`, `scale`, `speed`).
- **Scroll Progress Listener**: New `onProgress` callback that provides real-time scroll progress (0 to 1) for an element.
- **New Animation Presets**: Added `skew-in`, `scale-x`, `scale-y`.
- **Threshold Array Support**: `threshold` option now accepts an array of numbers for more granular progress tracking.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-25

- Initial release of `use-scroll-animate`.
- 16 built-in animation presets.
- Core `ScrollAnimate` singleton.
- HTML `data-sa` attribute API.
- React and Vue 3 integrations.
- Zero dependencies.
- ~2.9KB gzipped UMD bundle.
